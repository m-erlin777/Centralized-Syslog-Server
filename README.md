# Centralized-Syslog-Server
This project configures a Raspberry Pi 5 as a centralized syslog server to receive Windows Event Logs forwarded by NXLog over TCP. Logs are stored dynamically by hostname to facilitate organized log management. The setup highlights networking, Linux administration, Windows log forwarding, security hardening, and troubleshooting skills.
